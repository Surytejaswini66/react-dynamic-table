# Dynamic Table with Features

## Project Overview

The **Dynamic Table with Features** is a React-based application that enables users to interact with a dynamic table containing a set of features like single and multi-select dropdowns, row addition, deletion, inline editing, theme switching, and more. This project aims to showcase the use of React for managing dynamic data and handling UI interactions.

### Features Implemented:

- **Add New Row**: Users can add rows dynamically to the table.
- **Reset Table**: Reset the table to its initial state.
- **Inline Editing**: Users can edit selected options in Label 2 directly in the table.
- **Theme Toggle**: Toggle between light and dark mode for the tableâ€™s display.
- **Row Duplication**: Duplicate an entire row, including all the selected values.
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: The application is designed to be responsive across different device sizes.
- **Hover Effects**: Improved hover effects for options, dropdowns, and rows.

## Technologies Used
